# Library Database Design & Expansion (SQL Project)

## Project Objective
This project was developed as part of the Data Analyst Expert program at John Bryce College. The objective was to create and manage a relational database for a library system, using SQL to design tables, insert data, enforce constraints, and simulate transactions and rentals.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- T-SQL

## Key Features
- Creation of core tables: `Books`, `Authors`, `Readers`, `Rent`, `Payments`
- Implementation of foreign keys and data integrity constraints
- Data insertion with realistic values (books, rentals, ratings)
- Business logic additions: rent pricing and payment tracking
- Simulated purchase and rent flows with payment assignment

## Academic Result
Grade: **95/100**

## Notes
This SQL database was later used as a backend for a Power BI dashboard (see separate project).
